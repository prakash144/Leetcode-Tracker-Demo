## Firebase Setup

The app is statically hosted on GitHub Pages. Firebase is used from the client SDK only.

Create `.env.local` from `.env.example`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=
```

Firestore stores only user-specific progress:
- solved
- attempted
- bookmarked
- revision list
- notes
- activity counts for the heatmap

Problem metadata such as title, link, acceptance, difficulty, frequency, topic, company, and list continues to come from the GitHub CSV/API source.

Deploy the rules in `firestore.rules` to protect per-user progress data.
