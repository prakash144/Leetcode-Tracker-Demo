# Implementation Plan — Improvement Pass (v2)

> **Status:** All phases complete. Production Readiness Review passed. ✅
> **IMPORTANT:** No automatic updates to this file unless explicitly requested.

## Completed Phases

### 1. Heatmap Redesign — ✅
LeetCode-style contribution heatmap with SVG grid, month/day labels, green intensity scale, streak stats, time-range filters (Current/2025/2024/2023/180d/90d/30d), tooltip, legend.

### 2. Progress Page Enhancement — ✅
Two-column layout (Practice History + Summary sidebar). Sortable columns, debounced search, multi-filters (difficulty/status/company/topic), pagination (10/25/50), ProgressRingChart, monthly trend, recent stats + insights.

### 3. Dashboard Enhancement — ✅
Restructured layout with overall progress, difficulty breakdown with progress bars, company progress, quick actions, recent activity, weekly goal. Reuses Heatmap component.

### 4. Global Optimization & Polish — ✅
React.memo on key components, deleted unused code (MetricCard, StatusBadge, DonutChart, Checkbox, unused types/functions), `/analytics` → `/progress` redirect, company logos via Simple Icons CDN with CompanyBadge fallback, CSS variable card backgrounds.

### 5. Navigation Update — ✅
TopNav: Dashboard, Problems, Progress, Favorites, My Lists, Settings. Profile dropdown: My Profile, My Lists, Settings, Sign Out. (Theme selector moved to Settings page.)

### 6. Final Visual Consistency Pass — ✅
Difficulty color system (Easy=green, Medium=yellow, Hard=red) verified across all components. LeetCode-style ProgressRingChart (SVG ring with gaps, animated, clickable). Unified card backgrounds. Green focus/accent states. CompanyLogo component.

### 7. Production Theme System — ✅
Light / Dark / System modes with localStorage persistence. Semantic CSS variable system replacing all hardcoded dark colors across 32+ files. Flash-prevention inline script. 3-mode selector in Settings (Light / Dark / System buttons with active state). Accent color picker (Green / Blue / Purple / Orange) applied to focus rings. No `dark:` prefix variants — all theme-aware via CSS variables.

## Production Readiness Review — ✅

### Issues Found & Fixed

| Issue | Severity | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Missing `React` import in `CompanySearch.tsx` (used `React.Dispatch`/`React.SetStateAction` without import) | Critical | Added `import React` |
| `DonutChart.tsx` — unused component (dead code) | Critical | Removed file |
| `Checkbox.tsx` — unused component (dead code) | Critical | Removed file |
| `TopicSelector.tsx` missing `"use client"` directive | High | Added directive |
| `fetchQuestions.ts` (contains hook `useFetchQuestions`) missing `"use client"` | High | Added directive |
| Non-functional "Heatmap Visibility" toggle in Settings (plain `<div>` with no interaction) | High | Replaced with functional `<button role="switch">` with `aria-checked`, keyboard support |
| `formatRelativeTime.ts` — no null/undefined/NaN guard | Medium | Added guard returning `"—"` |
| Redundant second `useEffect` in `useTheme.ts` | Medium | Removed dead code |
| `hasError` passes `string | null` to `ErrorState`'s required `string` prop (Dashboard + Progress) | Medium | Added `typeof hasError === "string"` guard |
| Duplicate `key` values in Heatmap day labels (`""` for empty labels) | Medium | Changed to `key={i}` |
| SVG click handlers (`<g>`, `<circle>`) lack keyboard accessibility in ProgressRingChart | Medium | Added `role="button"`, `tabIndex`, `onKeyDown` (Enter/Space), `aria-label` |
| Clear search button in Progress page lacks `aria-label` | Medium | Added `aria-label="Clear search"` |
| Inline SVG chevron in Heatmap instead of lucide icon | Low | Replaced with `ChevronDown` from lucide-react |
| Duplicate Tailwind directives (`@import` v4 + `@tailwind` v3) in globals.css | Medium | Removed v3 directives |
| Universal `* { @apply border-border }` applies borders to all elements | Medium | Kept as-is (scoped via `border-border` var which defaults to transparent) |

### Validation Results

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | ✅ Passes — 11/11 static pages |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Passes — 0 errors, 1 pre-existing warning (`<img>` in CompanyLogo) |
| Typecheck | ✅ Passes (included in build) |
| Console errors | ✅ None (only `console.error` for API failures, no `console.log`) |
| Dead code | ✅ Removed `DonutChart.tsx`, `Checkbox.tsx` |
| Unused imports | ✅ None detected |

### Performance Optimizations
- Removed unused components reducing bundle size
- Fixed `useSyncExternalStore` + `useEffect` pattern in `useTheme.ts`
- React.memo already applied on Heatmap, ProgressRingChart, DifficultyBadge, TopicBadge

### Accessibility Improvements
- `role="button"` + `tabIndex` + `onKeyDown` on SVG chart segments
- `aria-label` on clear search button
- `aria-checked` + `role="switch"` on functional toggle
- Focus rings use `var(--accent-color)` CSS variable

## Final Validation

All checks pass:

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `npm run build` | ✅ Passes — 11/11 static pages generated |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ Passes — only pre-existing `<img>` warning in CompanyLogo.tsx |
| Typecheck | ✅ Passes (included in build) |
| Light mode | ✅ All components render correctly |
| Dark mode | ✅ All components render correctly |
| System mode | ✅ Follows OS preference, live updates via matchMedia listener |
| Theme persistence | ✅ Survives refresh, logout, browser restart |
| Accent color persistence | ✅ Stored in localStorage, applied via CSS variable |
| No hardcoded dark colors | ✅ All 32+ files use semantic CSS variables |
| No flash of incorrect theme | ✅ Inline script runs before first paint |
| Responsive | ✅ Tested at desktop, tablet, mobile |
| Accessibility | ✅ Keyboard nav, ARIA labels, semantic HTML, focus states |

## Open Decisions / Risks (carried forward, not buried in status markers)

- **Company logos**: resolved — initials badges (CompanyBadge) with Simple Icons CDN as enhancement, no bundled trademark assets.
- **Virtualization on the heatmap**: not built — 53 weeks renders fine without it.
- **`onSnapshot` vs `getDocs`**: per-feature decision, applied deliberately per read pattern.
- **Firebase API key exposure**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` keys are client-side by design; restrict in GCP Console to specific domains.
- **`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in layout**: required for flash-prevention; content is a hardcoded string, not user input.

## Production Readiness

✅ **Production Ready**

All blocking issues resolved. Zero build errors, zero lint errors, zero TypeScript errors. The application passes a comprehensive production readiness review covering code quality, performance, accessibility, security, and responsiveness.
